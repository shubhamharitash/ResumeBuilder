I Designed+Build Novoresume in 1 days !!!

Surprisingly resume generated by my ResumeBuilder got ATS score of 61 ,which is greater that my resume build by Novoresume (No offence to Novoresume )


So how I build ???

I build it using Java + Spring boot + OpenPdf maven Dependency + Mongo (for Persistence) .

Why choose mongoDB here?

Flexible Schema , read to write ratio

Why Open Pdf ?
Open source.

Wanna checkout exact code for this?
